- Persona Customization: Allow the user to customize various aspects of the personas (name, age, profession...) through an intuitive and dynamic interface.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Slate Blue (#6A5ACD) for a sophisticated and intellectual feel, used in gradients to add depth.
- Background color: Light Gray (#F0F0F0) with subtle textures or patterns to avoid a flat, sterile look.
- Accent color: Soft Lavender (#E6E6FA) for highlighting interactive elements, with hover effects and animations for feedback.
- Font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, will be used for both headlines and body text due to its modern and neutral appearance that suits extensive text, with variable font weights for emphasis.
- Use a dynamic, card-based layout for displaying persona information, with interactive elements and expandable sections to reveal more details.
- Subtle, playful animations on persona selection and data interaction to enhance user engagement and provide visual feedback.
- Use custom-designed icons with a consistent style to represent different traits and attributes, adding visual interest and clarity.
